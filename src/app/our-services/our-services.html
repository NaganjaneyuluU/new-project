            Why second-hand machines?
        </h3>
        <p class="text-[17px] text-[#666666] mb-3 leading-[1.7em]">
            There are many reasons to consider a used machine over a new one. They are an excellent alternative that can
            perform the
            same tasks. Used machines can be monitored and inspected in production, under real conditions. They also
            have a very high
            price advantage compared to new machines. Even larger companies prefer to invest in used high-quality and
            well-maintained
            machines. High-quality machines are very durable.
        </p>
        <p class="text-[17px] text-[#666666] mb-3 leading-[1.7em]">
            With a limited budget, companies can only invest in new machines with lower quality. These machines can
            cause problems
            such as downtime during production. Such machine manufacturers may not be able to provide adequate
            after-sales service,
            or problems that occur may not be covered by their warranty. There may be quality problems with products.
            All these
            problems cause costs that can exceed the cost of a second-hand machine.
        </p>
        <p class="text-[17px] text-[#666666] mb-3 leading-[1.7em]">
            For these reasons, the purchase of a used, renewed and well-maintained machine can be more advantageous and
            cost-efficient. However, the purchase of used machines has other advantages, such as:
