    II. The rights of users and data subjects
</h3>
<p style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
    With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
        to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed,
        further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
    </li>
    <li style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
        to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);
    </li>
    <li style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
        to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further
        processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
    </li>
    <li style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
        to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other
        providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
    </li>
    <li style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
        to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed
        by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
    </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
    In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections,
    deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation
    does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a
    right to information about these recipients.
</p>
<p style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
    <strong>
        Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller’s future
        processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing
        for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.

    III. Information about the data processing
</h3>
<p style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">

    to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless
    otherwise stipulated below.

    Server data
</h4>
<p style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
    For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider will be
    collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and version of
    your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited,
    the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.
</p>
<p style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
    The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.
</p>
<p style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
    The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement,
    stability, functionality, and security of our website.
</p>
<p style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
    The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued storage is required for evidentiary
    purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until the investigation of the
    relevant incident is finally resolved.

    a) Session cookies
</h4>
<p style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
    We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on your computer by
    your browser. These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your browser, location data, or
    IP address.
</p>
<p style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
    This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for example, to display
    our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function.
</p>
<p style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
    The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used to collect
    data to initiate or process contractual relationships.
</p>
<p style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
    If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the
    functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.
</p>
<p style="color: #666666;font-size: 17px;font-weight: 400;margin-bottom: 12px;">
    When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.

<h4>
    c) Disabling cookies
</h4>
<p>
    You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to
    delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the
    browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your
    browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash cookies from being set.
    Instead, you will need to change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this also
    depend on the Flash player you are using. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the
    documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for support.
</p>
<p>
    If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions on our site may be fully usable.

    If you contact us via email or the contact form, the data you provide will be used for the purpose of processing
    your request. We must have this data in order to process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we will not be able to

    We would like to point out that this might cause user data to be processed outside the European Union, particularly

    Social media links via graphics
</h4>
<p>
    We also integrate the following social media sites into our website. The integration takes place via a linked
    graphic of the respective site. The use of these graphics stored on our own servers prevents the automatic
    connection to the servers of these networks for their display. Only by clicking on the corresponding graphic will
    you be forwarded to the service of the respective social network.
</p>
<p>
    Once you click, that network may record information about you and your visit to our site. It cannot be ruled out
    that such data will be processed in the United States.
</p>
<p>
    Initially, this data includes such things as your IP address, the date and time of your visit, and the page visited.
    If you are logged into your user account on that network, however, the network operator might assign the information
    collected about your visit to our site to your personal account. If you interact by clicking Like, Share, etc., this
    information can be stored your personal user account and possibly posted on the respective network. To prevent this,
    you need to log out of your social media account before clicking on the graphic. The various social media networks
    also offer settings that you can configure accordingly.

</p>
<p>
    Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time, or frequency of your visits to our website will
    be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However, we use Google Analytics with the
    so-called anonymization function, whereby Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the EEA before it is
    transmitted to the US.
</p>
<p>
    The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of visits to our website
    and what visitors do once there. This data can also be used to provide other services related to the use of our
    website and of the internet in general.
</p>
<p>
    Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other data. In addition, Google provides further

    this does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analytics services we may use as
    detailed herein.

</p>
<p>
    To enable the display of certain fonts on our website, a connection to the Google server in the USA is established
    whenever our website is accessed.
</p>
<p>
    If you access the Google Maps components integrated into our website, Google will store a cookie on your device via
